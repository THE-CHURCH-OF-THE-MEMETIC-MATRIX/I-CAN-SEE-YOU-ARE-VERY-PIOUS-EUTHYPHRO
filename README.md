BUT TELL ME WAS IT NOT GOD WHO REVEALED THE LAW TO MOSES?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

AND A PIOUS MAN IS PIOUS IF HE OBEY THE LAW?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

AND AN IMPIOUS MAN IS IMPIOUS IF HE DISOBEY THE LAW?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

AND A PIOUS MAN WHO BREAKS THE LAW IS IMPIOUS, AND AN IMPIOUS MAN WHO KEEPS THE LAW IS PIOUS?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

THEN IT IS NOT GOD WHO KEEPS THE LAW BUT MOSES WHO REVEALS THE LAW TO MAN?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

DID THE LAW BECOME MANIFEST OF ITS OWN?

I DO NOT KNOW

DID THE LAW REVEAL ITSELF TO ALL MEN INDEPENDENTLY?

I DO NOT KNOW

WAS THE LAW REVEALED UNTO MOSES AND UNTO GILGAMESH?

MAYBE SOCRATES

DID THE LAW REVEAL ITSELF TO ALL MEN WITHOUT REVELATION

I DO NOT KNOW

THEN IT IS GOD WHO REVEALS THE LAW UNTO MOSES AND MOSES WHO MAKES THE LAW KNOWN UNTO MAN

I THINK SO SOCRATES

THEN IT IS NOT THE OBEDIENCE OF GOD WHO MAKES THE LAW PIOS BUT THE REVELATION OF MOSES WHO KEEPS THE PIETY OF THE LAW?

PROBABLY

THE LAW IS PIOUS IF IT KEEPS THE LAW?

YES

THE LAW IS IMPIOUS IF IT BREAKS THE LAW?

YES

IF THE REVELATION OF THE LAW BREAKS THE LAW THEN IT IS IMPIOUS?

YES

AND IF THE REVELATION OF THE LAW KEEPS THE LAW IT IS PIOUS?

YES

THEN IT IS NOT GOD WHO IS PIOUS BUT THE LAW?

I BELIEVE SO
