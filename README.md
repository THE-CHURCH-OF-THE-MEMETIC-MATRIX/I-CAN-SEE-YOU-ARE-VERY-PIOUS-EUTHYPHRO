BUT TELL ME WAS IT NOT GOD WHO REVEALED THE LAW TO MOSES?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

AND A PIOUS MAN IS PIOUS IF HE OBEY THE LAW?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

AND AN IMPIOUS MAN IS IMPIOUS IF HE DISOBEY THE LAW?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

AND A PIOUS MAN WHO BREAKS THE LAW IS IMPIOUS, AND AN IMPIOUS MAN WHO KEEPS THE LAW IS PIOUS?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

THEN IT IS NOT GOD WHO KEEPS THE LAW BUT MOSES WHO REVEALS THE LAW TO MAN?

YES I BELIEVE THAT IS SO

DID THE LAW BECOME MANIFEST OF ITS OWN?

I DO NOT KNOW

DID THE LAW REVEAL ITSELF TO ALL MEN INDEPENDENTLY?

I DO NOT KNOW

WAS THE LAW REVEALED UNTO MOSES AND UNTO GILGAMESH?

MAYBE SOCRATES

DID THE LAW REVEAL ITSELF TO ALL MEN WITHOUT REVELATION

I DO NOT KNOW

THEN IT IS GOD WHO REVEALS THE LAW UNTO MOSES AND MOSES WHO MAKES THE LAW KNOWN UNTO MAN

I THINK SO SOCRATES
